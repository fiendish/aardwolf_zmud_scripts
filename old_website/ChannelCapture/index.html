<h1>Fiendish's Super Amazing Channel Capture Script For zMUD<BR></h1>
Tested to work in zMUD 7.21 on Windows XP. Not guaranteed to work in other versions or system configurations.<BR>
What this script does:
<ul><li>Captures channels to a separate window with the option to either show or hide the channels in the main window.</li></ul>
What this script does not do:
<ul>
<li>Create multiple tabs, one for each different channel. Limitations in zMUD prevent scripting that. You'll have to do it yourself if you want. See below for instructions how.</ul>
New in the September 14, 2008 update:<BR>
<ul><li>I simplified the structure a bit by combining two triggers into one. I think I also fixed a bug with the option to hide channel output from the main window related to channel output not always being followed by a blank line.</li>
<li>I added instructions for making your own channel tabs below.</li></ul>
New in the August 28, 2008 update:<BR>
<ul><li>Should no longer have trouble with lines containing curly braces. Thanks to Haldrik for spotting this.</li></ul>

Download the script here: <a href="ChannelCapture.zip">Channel Capture Script</a><BR>
<B>Want to learn how to use this script to make multiple tabs for different channels?</B> <a href="HowToMakeChannelTabs.html">Click here to see the Channel Tabs Guide</a>.<BR><BR>
IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL THIS SCRIPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW YOU WILL BE SORRY.<BR><BR>
------------ BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS ------------<BR><BR>
This script installs a class named "ChannelCapture" after deleting existing classes of the same name.<BR>
If any of your scripts conflict with this class name, they must be removed first or they'll be removed for you.<BR><BR>
To install the script go to the Actions menu in zMUD and choose "Execute script..."<BR>
<img src="../how_to_execute_file1.png" alt="How to execute files step 1"><BR>
<BR>
Then select the text file containing the script, in this case ChannelCapture.txt, and click Open<BR>
<img src="../how_to_execute_file2.png" alt="How to execute files step 2"><BR>
<BR>
The script then installs and pops up your new channels window.<BR>
zMUD will ask you to save a file called CHANNELS.mud. Just click SAVE.<BR>
<BR>
Now you need to resize/dock the channels window to your liking and then go to the Layout menu and lock and save your layout.<BR>
<BR>If you want channel output to only go to the capture window and not to the main window, type "hidechannels"<BR><BR>.
If you have questions, feel free to send tells.<BR><BR>
